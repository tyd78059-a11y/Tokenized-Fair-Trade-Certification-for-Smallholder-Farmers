# 🌱 Tokenized Fair Trade Certification for Smallholder Farmers

Welcome to a revolutionary Web3 solution that empowers smallholder farmers with transparent, automated fair trade certification! This project uses the Stacks blockchain and Clarity smart contracts to tokenize certifications, track supply chains, and automatically distribute premiums, solving real-world issues like opaque certification processes, delayed payments, and exploitation in global trade.

## ✨ Features

🌍 Register and certify smallholder farms on-chain  
📈 Tokenize fair trade status as NFTs for verifiable ownership  
🔄 Track products from farm to market with immutable records  
💰 Automate premium payouts based on sales and compliance  
🛡️ Ensure transparency with on-chain audits and disputes  
🤝 Enable community governance for certification standards  
📊 Integrate oracles for real-world data like market prices  
🚀 Prevent fraud with unique hashes and multi-signature approvals  

## 🛠 How It Works

This project leverages 8 interconnected Clarity smart contracts to create a decentralized ecosystem for fair trade. It addresses the problem of smallholder farmers in developing regions who often face unfair pricing, lack of certification access, and delayed premiums from buyers. By tokenizing certifications and automating processes, farmers get faster payments, buyers gain trust, and the system reduces administrative overhead.

### Smart Contracts Overview

1. **FarmerRegistry.clar**: Handles farmer registration, storing profiles with details like location, crop type, and unique IDs. Ensures only verified farmers can participate.  
2. **CertificationNFT.clar**: Mints NFTs representing fair trade certifications. Farmers claim NFTs after audits, which can be transferred or revoked based on compliance.  
3. **SupplyChainTracker.clar**: Logs product batches with hashes for traceability. Tracks from harvest to sale, linking to certifications.  
4. **PremiumPool.clar**: Manages a pooled fund for premiums. Buyers deposit funds, and smart logic distributes based on verified sales.  
5. **OracleIntegrator.clar**: Fetches external data (e.g., commodity prices) via trusted oracles to trigger automated events like premium calculations.  
6. **GovernanceDAO.clar**: Allows stakeholders (farmers, certifiers) to vote on standards, upgrades, or disputes using a governance token.  
7. **AuditLogger.clar**: Records all audits and compliance checks immutably, enabling verifiers to query historical data.  
8. **DisputeResolver.clar**: Facilitates on-chain dispute resolution with multi-party arbitration and escrow for contested premiums.  

### For Farmers

- Register your farm via FarmerRegistry with basic info and proof of ownership.  
- Apply for certification: Submit evidence (e.g., hashes of farm audits) to CertificationNFT for minting.  
- Track your products: Use SupplyChainTracker to log batches and link to your NFT.  
- Receive premiums: Once sales are verified, PremiumPool automatically disburses funds to your wallet.  

Boom! Your fair trade status is tokenized, traceable, and profitable.

### For Buyers and Certifiers

- Verify certifications: Query CertificationNFT or AuditLogger to confirm a farmer's status.  
- Deposit premiums: Send funds to PremiumPool when purchasing certified products.  
- Track supply: Use SupplyChainTracker to ensure product authenticity from source.  
- Participate in governance: Vote in GovernanceDAO to update rules or resolve disputes via DisputeResolver.  

That's it! Automated, transparent fair trade for a better world.
